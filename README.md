# Airline-Tweets-Analysis
Given tweets about six US airlines, the task is to predict whether a tweet contains positive, negative, or neutral sentiment about the airline. This is a typical supervised learning task where given a text string, we have to categorize the text string into predefined categories.

# Method 
To solve this problem, we will follow the typical machine learning pipeline. We will first import the required libraries and the dataset. We will then do exploratory data analysis to see if we can find any trends in the dataset. Next, we will perform text preprocessing to convert textual data to numeric data that can be used by a machine learning algorithm. Finally, we will use machine learning algorithms to train and test our sentiment analysis models.
